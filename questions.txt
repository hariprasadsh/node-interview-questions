* what is buffer in node js?
    buffer is a way to store and manipulate binary data in node js (image, videos, raw data from network)
    we can do operations like slice, concatenate etc.
* What is a middleware in node js?
    middlewares executed when a request reach a server and before controller sends the response
    middleware has access to request, response and next
* Event Loop
    Microtasks queue (priority)
    Macrotasks queue
* setImmediate
    used to execute right after a curret event loop finishes
    same as setTimeout but no delays
* Stubs
    smaller program routines that substitutes a longer program
    dummy objects for testing
    implement a pre-programed response
* clustering
    technique used to enhance and scale node applications
    clustering enables us to create multiple identical worker processes instead of runningf a single node process
* Worker threads and clusters
 - Worker Threads
    feature of node js that allows to run javascript code parallel to main threads
    useful for performing CPU-intense js operations
    not much help with I/O intensive work
    Worker.on(message), Worker.on(error), Worker.on(exit)
 - clusters
    used to run multiple instances in a single threaded node application
    cluster module allows to create child processes that all share the server port
    each child process will have its own memory, event loop, v8 instance and shares the server port
    cluster.fork() is used to create child processes
* process
    is a global object that can be called inside any module without requiring it
    provides various information about the runtime of a program
    process.exit()
    process.stdin // readable stream
    process.stdout // writable stream
    process.stderr // writable stream that recognises error
    process.argv // is an array which contain node itself as the first element and absolute path of file as second element
