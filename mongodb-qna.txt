* mongodb
    document based database
    db->collections(tables)->documents(rows)->key-value pair
    use <dbname> - create or switch to an existing db
    db.<collection name>.insertMany() - insert into a new collection multiple documents
        insertOne() - will insert single document into a new collection
        find() - will display all documents
            $lte - lesser than or equal to
            $gte - greater than or equal to
            $lt - less than
            $gt - greater than

        updateOne() - will update single document
            eg: db.tours.updateOne({name: "The snow adventurer"}, {$set: {price: 697}}) - will update the price of the tour name The snow adventurer
                even if there were multiple documents, the updateOne() will only update first document

        deleteMany() - will delete more than one documents at once
            to delete all the documents  - db.tours.deleteMany({})
